The main activity managing a subscription is to manage the users assigned to that subscription. That is done from the users tab either by searching for users by their name or email. You can also view the users who has requested a licenes and manual approve their requests. 

**Auto approval of licenses requests**

Subscription owners can also turn on Auto approval for licensing requests on the settings tab. By doing so the need for manual intervention for assigning a user to a license is removed. 
With the auto aproval turned on - unlicensed users requesting a license will directly be assigned a licenses and taken diretctly to the export tab, provided that the subscription has availble users to assign.
