Q: There is a new Azure DevOps feature in preview for Test Plans.  When using this preview feature the ability to Export Test results using your extension is removed.

A: 
The new Test hub is in preview, and not feature complete yet. 
One of the core things missing is extensibility, and Microsoft still has it on the backlog to add the current extensibility to the new test hub. 

Once Microsoft implements it – the Enhanced Export PRO extension will light up in the new experience.
