## Introduction
Enhanced Export PRO is designed to be easy to use and yet powerful and flexible to
create custom solutions to be able to meet all your requirements. To solve this, we
have put focus on making the everyday operations needed by most users easy to use
and easily accessible as an **Export Tab** on work item queries and test plans.

Having the output look and feel like your organizationâ€™s documentation is also
something we have focused on making easy do. You can simply **take your own word
document** and make Enhanced export PRO use it as word template for its word
export. Images and other resources are of course embedded in the exported
document so you can share it with others.

To enable the power and flexibility, customized solutions can be created and
packaged as a onetime effort and then used by everyone. All advanced feature
needed for creating customized solutions is put into the Admin Hub.
