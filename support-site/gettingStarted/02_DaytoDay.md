## Export tab for day to day operations
For your day to day operations you have the export tab right in your workflow, just
click on the export tab and it will render a report with your current Work Item Query
or Test plan.
Functionality in the export tab
Template selector The template selector lets you select what template
you want to render the report. The template defines
the structure and layout of how the data is presented.
By choosing different templates your data can be
presented like a grid, a specification or a traceability
matrix. You can easily copy or create your own custom
templates in the Admin hub.
Options Options lets you mainly control what extra data you
want to collect. Collecting more data gives you more
detailed reports but takes more time.
The available options are different between work item
queries and test plans. 
Decorators Decorators lets you apply different styling rules to the
report.
Clicking this will show the available Decorators and
lets you choose which ones you want to apply and set
properties if the decorator has any.
